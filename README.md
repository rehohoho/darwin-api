# darwin-api-tutorials
Tutorial videos, posts, and source code in Python &amp; R to assist algorithmic traders and DARWIN investors.

## Need help? Join the [Darwinex Collective Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/darwinex-collective/shared_invite/enQtNjg4MjA0ODUzODkyLWFiZWZlMDZjNGVmOGE2ZDBiZGI4ZWUxNjM5YTU0MjZkMTQ2NGZjNGIyN2QxZDY4NjUyZmVlNmU3N2E2NGE1Mjk) for Q&A, debug and more.

## IMPORTANT NOTES - PLEASE READ:
1. Please note that we cannot provide support for Python/R as programming languages themselves. Therefore, if you are new to Python/R, incorporating the project into your specific algorithmic trading environment will require some additional work on your part (i.e. enough Python experience to integrate the code here into your environment -> it is assumed that users are self-sufficient in Python).

2. Any code provided and/or referenced in this repository is NOT meant to be used "as-is". Users must treat all code as educational content that requires modification / incorporation into existing works, as per their individual requirements.

3. We have drafted as detailed a set of steps as possible in our tutorial videos ([available here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDDHyjqt_TY&list=PLv-cA-4O3y96EwRy0T6Y6CY52_x9Zdec9)), but cannot cover all the dependencies as they are independent projects on their own that programmers need to account for / follow / keep up to speed with when considering using the example code in this repository.
